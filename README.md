Hello fellow coders and RPG-fans!                                             (03. July 2017)

I´m Ezgi, a computer science student (since 2012) and somewhat introverted, 
fascinated with architecture and a practitioner of yoga/ qi-gong. As a student I try to 
sate my curiousity by learning new things everyday. But it doesn´t always work...

My personality is introverted and quiet, but I´m a good listener and always contribute to my team. 
Maybe a bit too honest and genuine, but I am always polite, don´t want to hurt anyone feelings.

I work hard about any of my favorite topics and interests and can get quite absorbed in it, 
when it is really interesting to me. (-.-) Sometimes not the right topics...

My Repositoty ist still new and in building, but I hope that it´s soon filled with a lot of interesting code for anyone to see.


Sign off,
Ezgi
